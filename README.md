# Weather Dashboard

For this assignment, I was tasked to create a weather dashboard with the following requirements

- search by city and state
- save the searched cities in local storage and retrieve the details
- Weather data for each city including: weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
- The UV index will indicate with a color scale the strength of the UV alert
- Each city must also show a 5-day forecast
